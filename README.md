# Claude Traffic Light 🚦

> A tiny traffic-light indicator for [Claude Code](https://claude.com/claude-code)
> sessions — always visible in your **macOS menu bar** or **Windows system tray**,
> so you know at a glance whether Claude is working, done, or waiting on you.

- 🟡 **Yellow** — Claude is working / writing code
- 🔴 **Red** — Claude asked a question, needs permission, or is waiting for you
- 🟢 **Green** — Claude finished, it's your turn
- ⚫ **Off** — no active sessions

With multiple Claude sessions open, the icon shows the **most attention-worthy**
state (priority: **red > yellow > green**). Click it to see every session on its own
row, and click a row to jump straight to that chat (VS Code / Cursor / terminal /
Claude desktop). When a session turns red, you get a native notification.

**No network, no tokens, no telemetry** — it only reads local
`~/.claude/status/*.json` files that Claude Code hooks write. Fully offline. The
macOS and Windows apps share the exact same status contract, so they behave
identically and can even run side by side.

Pin the widget and collapse it down to just the light — it stays **always on top**,
so you can keep an eye on Claude while you're watching a video, browsing, or in any
other app, and glance over the moment it turns red.

## ⬇️ Download & install

All ready-to-run builds are published on the
**[Releases page »](https://github.com/merve/claude-traffic-light/releases/latest)**.
Pick your platform below.

### 🍎 macOS

1. Download **`ClaudeTrafficLightMenuBar.dmg`** from the
   [latest release](https://github.com/merve/claude-traffic-light/releases/latest).
2. Open the DMG and drag **Claude Traffic Light** into **Applications**.
3. Launch it. On first run it self-installs the Claude Code hook, sets up
   launch-at-login, and the traffic light appears in your menu bar.

_(Optional)_ **`ClaudeTrafficWidget.dmg`** adds a draggable, pinnable floating
widget with a live session list — install it the same way. It's a read-only
viewer, so it needs the menu-bar app installed at least once first (that's what
sets up the hook). Runs fine alongside the menu-bar app, or standalone.

> **Gatekeeper note:** both apps are unsigned. On first open, macOS may say
> _"Apple cannot check it for malicious software."_ Go to **System Settings →
> Privacy & Security → Open Anyway**, or run
> `xattr -dr com.apple.quarantine "/Applications/<app name>.app"`.

**Prefer to build from source?** See the [macOS guide »](macos/README.md) —
one command: `cd macos && ./install.sh`.

### 🪟 Windows

Two independent builds — grab either or both from the
[latest release](https://github.com/merve/claude-traffic-light/releases/latest).
Both are **self-contained** (no .NET install required).

- **`ClaudeTrafficLightTrayApp.exe`** — the **system-tray** traffic light (recommended).
- **`ClaudeTrafficWidget.exe`** — an optional **always-on-top desktop widget** you
  can drag anywhere on screen.

Install:

1. Put the `.exe`(s) in a **permanent** folder, e.g.
   `%LOCALAPPDATA%\ClaudeTrafficLight\` (don't leave them on the Desktop — moving
   them later breaks autostart).
2. Double-click **`ClaudeTrafficLightTrayApp.exe`**. On first run it self-installs the
   Claude Code hook (backs up `settings.json` first) and registers autostart. The
   light shows up near the clock (bottom-right). If hidden, click the **^** arrow.
3. _(Optional)_ Double-click **`ClaudeTrafficWidget.exe`** for the desktop widget.

> **SmartScreen note:** the exe is unsigned, so Windows may warn on first run.
> Choose **More info → Run anyway**.

## 🔧 How it works

Two pieces, on both platforms:

1. **A Claude Code hook** fires on session events (`UserPromptSubmit`, `PreToolUse`,
   `PermissionRequest`, `Stop`, …) and writes a per-session status file to
   `~/.claude/status/<session_id>.json`.
2. **The tray / menu-bar app** reads those files about once a second and updates the
   traffic light, collapsing multiple sessions to the highest-priority color.

| Claude Code event                                 | Meaning           |   Color   |
| ------------------------------------------------- | ----------------- | :-------: |
| `UserPromptSubmit`, `PreToolUse`, `PostToolUse`   | Working           |    🟡     |
| `PostToolUseFailure`, `PermissionDenied`          | Working (tool failed / denied → Claude continues) | 🟡 |
| `PreToolUse` (`AskUserQuestion` / `ExitPlanMode`) | Waiting on you    |    🔴     |
| `PermissionRequest`, `Notification`*              | Waiting on you    |    🔴     |
| `SubagentStart`                                   | Working (background agent running) | 🟡 |
| `SubagentStop`                                    | Unchanged — only clears the agent from the active set | — |
| `Stop`, `StopFailure`                             | Response finished |    🟢     |
| `Stop` (a background subagent is still running)** | Working           |    🟡     |
| `Stop` (reply ends with a blocking question)      | Waiting on you    |    🔴     |
| `Stop` (courtesy closer: "anything else?")        | Response finished |    🟢     |
| `SessionEnd`                                      | Session ended     | (removed) |

\* `Notification` is filtered by an allowlist that's deliberately inverted: only
the types that genuinely mean "waiting on you" (`permission_prompt`,
`elicitation_dialog`, `agent_needs_input`, mid-turn idle) go red, elicitation
completion goes back to yellow, and **everything else — including an unknown or
missing type — repaints nothing at all.** That way a future notification type
(or an older Claude Code version where the field never arrives) can never light
a false red mid-turn; a real permission wait already goes red via the separate
`PermissionRequest` event either way.

\** A background subagent finishing its own turn used to paint the shared
session green (its `Stop`) even while the user's actual request was still
running, then flip back yellow on the next tool call — visible flicker that
told the user "done" while work continued. The light now tracks active
subagent ids and stays yellow through the real `Stop` while any are still
running (a detected question always outranks this and still goes red).

When a chat closes, the app notices its process is gone, drops the row, and deletes
the stale status file — so the list stays clean.

**Red-trust gate.** Red means "a question is visible in a chat you are actually in".
When an IDE window reloads, its extension silently resumes old sessions in the
background; the resumed process immediately re-fires the pending-question
`Notification`, which would light a red you can never find or answer. The hook
grants trust only to an event that actually proves you're present: you just typed
(`UserPromptSubmit`), the session has a visible terminal (a controlling tty /
console) or is the always-visible Claude desktop app, or the previous write from
the same process was already trusted. Anything else keeps whatever trust it had
before (untrusted by default); an untrusted red is recorded as green.
